# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets.  When scrolling quickly, the list fails to render items correctly, leaving blank spaces or displaying incorrect data.

## Bug Description
The issue is observed when the FlatList component renders a considerable amount of data, and scrolling quickly causes performance degradation. This leads to visual inconsistencies such as blank spaces where items should be rendered.

## Solution
The solution involves improving the performance of the FlatList component using optimization strategies like `getItemLayout` and `windowSize`. These strategies minimize the number of rendered items during scrolling and improve rendering efficiency.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Scroll quickly through the FlatList.
