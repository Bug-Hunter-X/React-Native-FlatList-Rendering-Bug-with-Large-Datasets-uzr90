This React Native bug occurs when using the FlatList component with a large dataset.  The issue is that when scrolling quickly, the FlatList component fails to render items correctly, resulting in blank spaces or incorrect item display. This happens due to the combination of excessive data and inefficient rendering optimization strategies within FlatList. The problem is particularly noticeable when dealing with complex data structures, images or other resource-intensive components within the item render function.
